      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        Iâ€™m <strong>Khalos Moscato</strong>, a creative and detail-oriented software
        engineer based in London, U.K. After excelling in luxury retail at Louis Vuitton
        and Oyuna, I transitioned into tech and have since built full-stack web and mobile
        apps with technologies like React, TypeScript, Node.js, C#, .NET, PostgreSQL,
        MongoDB, and AWS.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        Iâ€™m passionate about <strong>DevOps</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>AI/ML engineering</strong>, and Iâ€™m always curious to explore new
        technologies, whether in fintech, biotech, or game development.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        Outside of tech, youâ€™ll find me <strong>cycling</strong>,{' '}
        <strong>travelling</strong>, playing the <strong>piano</strong>, or enjoying a
        good video game ðŸŽ®. I value openness, diversity, and collaboration, and I thrive
        in inclusive environments.
